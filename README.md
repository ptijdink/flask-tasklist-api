# flask-tasklist-api
The "Flask Tasklist API" is a RESTful API developed with Flask for managing tasks. Users can add, remove, update, and search tasks. The API supports pagination, filtering, and sorting.

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Create a publicly accessible git repository.
- [x] Initialize a new Flask project in the repository.
- [x] Configure the project structure according to best practices.
- [x] Add the necessary dependencies to the project, such as Flask.
- [x] Implement a basic Flask application running on a local development server.

### Phase 2: Task List API Design
- [x] Define the data models for tasks.
- [ ] Design the endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
- [ ] Implement the endpoints for basic operations without functionality.
- [ ] Document the API endpoints and their expected payloads.

### Phase 3: Implementation of Basic Functionality
- [ ] Implement the logic for retrieving all tasks and a specific task.
- [ ] Implement the logic for adding a new task.
- [ ] Implement the logic for updating and deleting an existing task.
- [ ] Test the functionality of the API handlers using Postman or a similar tool.

### Phase 4: Adding Additional Functionality
- [ ] Implement a search endpoint for tasks with support for pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- [ ] Implement unit tests for the API endpoints to validate functionality.
- [ ] Add authorization functionality to the API, for example, using JWT tokens.
- [ ] Optional: Integrate Azure services such as Azure Blob Storage for file storage (may be mocked).

### Phase 5: Code Optimization and Documentation
- [ ] Refactor the code to improve reusability and performance, for example, by using caching.
- [ ] Add unit tests to ensure code quality.
- [ ] Add detailed comments to the code to explain the logic and decision-making.
- [ ] Document the API using tools such as Swagger/OpenAPI.

### Phase 6: Final Review and Completion
- [ ] Perform a final review to ensure all functionalities work correctly.
- [ ] Ensure the codebase is well-structured and meets the specified assessment criteria.
- [ ] Make final commits and push the code to the git repository.
- [ ] Submit the application for evaluation and review.
